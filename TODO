* design a decorator mechanism for printing
  * e.g. conwayTextPrinter(myConwayEngine), conwayGUI(myConwayEngine), etc.
* think about increasing
  * encapsulation
  * decoupling
* think about more ruby-like techniques:
  * using symbols instead of boolen (:alive instead of true)
    * performance-impact? Symbol comparison is O(1)
        * 120x50:
          *65.4609653684464 ticks/sec (true/false)
          *(:alive/:dead)
  * using map! instead of each_with_index
  * use inject where adequate
* System
  * get ruby-opengl running! Mess betwenn ruby 1.8 & 1.9?
